Serial start-up founder featured in National TV News with start-up and corporate professional experience as a developer. Nowadays, offering my capabilities to companies worldwide as a fully remote B2B Contrator for Software Development services.

## Why most of my activity is not shown in Github?
- There are developers that are very active in the open-source community and there are others that are not. In both gropus you could find excellent profiles that are a nice fit for your team. In my case, specifically, most of my development efforts have been done contributing to propietary code from businesses or personal private projects and not open-source contributions.
